## Data Availability - Raw data

Raw data files are *not* tracked in this repository for privacy/FERPA reasons and are excluded via `.gitignore`.

If you are cloning this project, you must manually place the dataset into the `DataRaw/` folder before knitting the R Markdown file.

The file must be named exactly as named in the codes.
