# BIOS 6624 – Course Repository

This repository contains my projects for BIOS 6624.

Each project will be organized using a consistent directory structure to support reproducible research, including folders for background, analysis code, and reports where appropriate. Git and GitHub are used for version control and reproducibility throughout the course.

This repository will be updated throughout the semester as projects are completed.

Details about the folders:

Background | contains the background information for the analysis
Code | contains all R scripts for this project
DataRaw | contain all raw data provided by investigators
DataProcessed | contains the processed data used for analysis
Reports | contains all output, rmarkdown files and report
