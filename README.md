# BIOS 6624 – Course Repository

This repository contains my projects for BIOS 6624.

Each project will be organized using a consistent directory structure to support reproducible research, including folders for code, data and results where appropriate. Git and GitHub are used for version control and reproducibility throughout the course.

This repository will be updated throughout the semester as projects are completed.
